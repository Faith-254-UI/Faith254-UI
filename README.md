## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently a dedicated learner in the <b>ALX Front-End Program</b>, where I'm growing my skills and working toward becoming a standout web developer.

💡 I started learning software engineering because I’ve always been fascinated by how beautiful, interactive websites are built. The ability to turn an idea into a functional, elegant interface truly inspires me.

🌟 I’m passionate about:
- Crafting clean and accessible user interfaces
- Responsive design and mobile-first development
- Building smooth user experiences with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Learning new tools and frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS

## 🎯 My Vision

I want to use technology to create inclusive, intuitive digital experiences that empower users and solve real-world problems.  
My goal is to grow into a confident front-end engineer who can work on:
- 🌐 Portfolio websites and landing pages
- 💼 Business apps and dashboards
- 📱 Mobile-first web applications
- 🧩 Open-source UI components
